THINGS TO DO
Creating a default configuration file
Saving configuration file
Logging
Faster build process
Clean up tests, proper formatting test_*.py files
Lastly add a UI



**** Lets think about how users will use this, from advanced to beginner ******
Newbie.
Step 1. Download installer for MS or Apple

Advanced usage, we'll handle this case first. 
*Able to follow instructions to give command line parameters to begin use
*Will be able to use the built/source distributions to install, (Optional) possibly within a virtual environment




(LOW PRIORITY - introduce functional style in rust)
Need to clear the state in between invocations of the server during the same import,
this is hard to do in functional style, cannot call a function to change the modules
state, unless using global call, although this seems bad style.
	

=> HOW DO WE MAINTAIN CLIENT (ACTIVE INSTRUMENT SCENE MAPPINGS) state
that must be accessible to both of 
	handle_message
	handle_midi

CONFIG
local-address
local-port
logging: on/off
midi-port configurations
    number of ports (16 channels per port)


SERVICE API
To allow for people to build there own clients to connect to hydra, a 
good api is needed. 
It should have a list of error codes in response to bad input.


URGENT TODO
automatically configure ports. There is a midi ouptut port in the
midi_handler that is setup purely for testing and is not needed otherwise.
Automatic should be fine though we may need to add options to the configuration
for manual setup.

- Investigate communication security.
Need to establish legitimate identity of the clients to prevent
other network messages being targeted at the server.
