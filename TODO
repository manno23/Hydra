Need to clear the state in between invocations of the server during the same import,
this is hard to do in functional style, cannot call a function to change the modules
state, unless using global call, although this seems bad style.
	

=> HOW DO WE MAINTAIN CLIENT (ACTIVE INSTRUMENT SCENE MAPPINGS) state
that must be accessible to both of 
	handle_message
	handle_midi


NO PRIORITY
setting up vi plugins not neccesary for now - don't sidetrack
	- although, the problem that has arisen is related to the build of vim,
	syntastic requires that the python version in vim matches the path pointed to,
	so the virtual-env is upsetting the versioning

	so to switch the setup, it depends on the environment (with or without the venv)
	the variables


						vim-python					vim-python3
pydoc_exec=				/usr/bin/pydoc				/usr/bin/pydoc3
syntastic_python_exec=	/usr/bin/python				/usr/bin/python3
		
1)vim-virtualenv should be determining the environment, but can we change 
the version of vim that is running 
2) vim-virtualenv cannot add the virtualenv python path that is at odds with 
the python build in vim

#We will not worry about completion
