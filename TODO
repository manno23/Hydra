Need to clear the state in between invocations of the server during the same import,
this is hard to do in functional style, cannot call a function to change the modules
state, unless using global call, although this seems bad style.
	

=> HOW DO WE MAINTAIN CLIENT (ACTIVE INSTRUMENT SCENE MAPPINGS) state
that must be accessible to both of 
	handle_message
	handle_midi


NO PRIORITY
setting up vi plugins not neccesary for now - don't sidetrack
	- although, the problem that has arisen is related to the build of vim,
	syntastic requires that the python version in vim matches the path pointed to,
	so the virtual-env is upsetting the versioning

	so to switch the setup, it depends on the environment (with or without the venv)
	the variables


						vim-python					vim-python3
pydoc_exec=				/usr/bin/pydoc				/usr/bin/pydoc3
syntastic_python_exec=	/usr/bin/python				/usr/bin/python3
		
1)vim-virtualenv should be determining the environment, but can we change 
the version of vim that is running 
2) vim-virtualenv cannot add the virtualenv python path that is at odds with 
the python build in vim

#We will not worry about completion



THINGS TO DO
Creating a default configuration file
Saving configuration file
Logging
Faster build process
Clean up tests, proper formatting test_*.py files
Lastly add a UI



**** Lets think about how users will use this, from advanced to beginner ******
Newbie.
Step 1. Download installer for MS or Apple

Advanced usage, we'll handle this case first. 
*Able to follow instructions to give command line parameters to begin use
*Will be able to use the built/source distributions to install, (Optional) possibly within a virtual environment
